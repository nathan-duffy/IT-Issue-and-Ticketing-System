**Overview:**
<br>
<br>
First end to end project completed at my internship during the summer of 2018.  Was tasked with creating or utilizing a platform that the information technology department would use for issue ticketing and software inventory.  Ended up utilizing the content management system, Drupal, to house these two systems.  Leveraged my understanding of user interface/experience (UI/UX) to design and configure this website for usage by the employees.  This system I created is continually being used and maintained by the department to easily access issue tickets and to keep track of download history on company hardware.

**What I Learned:**
<br>
<br>
•	Throughout the process I realized the need to accomplish small tasks at a time and plan out the path to completion.  
•	Nobody was looking over my back, or helping me through every bump I encountered.  This led me to become self-motivated and pace   myself throughout the project.
<br>
•	I encountered numerous problems with Drupal and each one came with their own challenges.
<br>
•	Delivering presentations to Randy based off small completions was important to keep him updated on my progress.
<br>
•	I leveraged what I already knew about user interface and experience to create and understand the systems I was developing.
