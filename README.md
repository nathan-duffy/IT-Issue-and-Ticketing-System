# IT-Issue-and-Ticketing-System

First end to end project completed at my internship during the summer of 2018.  Was tasked with creating or utilizing a platform that the information technology department would use for issue ticketing and software inventory.  Ended up utilizing the content management system, Drupal, to house these two systems.  Leveraged my understanding of user interface/experience (UI/UX to design and configure this website for usage by the employees.  This system I created is continually being used and maintained by the department to easily access issue tickets and to keep track of download history on company hardware.
